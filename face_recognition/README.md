# üéØ Real-Time Face Recognition 

A Python-based real-time face detection and ide## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Camera Settings
- Default camera index is set to `0`
- If you have multiple cameras, modify `CAMERA_INDEX` in `main.py`:
  ```python
  CAMERA_INDEX = 1  # Change to 1, 2, etc. as needed
  ```

### Performance Optimization
- The system resizes frames to 25% for faster processing
- Adjust the resize factor in `main.py` if needed:
  ```python
  img_small = cv2.resize(img, (0, 0), fx=0.25, fy=0.25)  # Modify fx and fy values
  ```

## üìù Dependencies

```
deepface          # Advanced face analysis
gradio           # Web interface framework
opencv-python    # Computer vision library
numpy            # Numerical computing
face_recognition # Face recognition library (auto-installed with deepface)
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Camera not working:**
- Check if camera is connected and not being used by another application
- Try different camera indices (0, 1, 2) in the configuration

**Face not recognized:**
- Ensure reference images are clear and well-lit
- Add multiple photos of the same person from different angles
- Check that image files are in the correct format

**Performance issues:**
- Reduce frame size by adjusting the resize factor
- Close other applications using the camera
- Ensure good lighting conditions

**Installation errors:**
- Make sure you have Python 3.7+
- Install Visual Studio Build Tools (Windows) for face_recognition library
- Use `pip install --upgrade pip` before installing requirements

**Enjoy your face recognition system! üéâ**cation system that uses computer vision to recognize faces from a webcam feed. The system compares detected faces against a database of known individuals and provides instant visual feedback.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-Time Face Detection**: Processes live video feeds to detect faces instantly
- **Face Recognition**: Identifies known faces by comparing them against pre-loaded reference images
- **Visual Feedback**: 
  - ‚úÖ **Green boxes** with names for recognized faces
  - ‚ùå **Red boxes** with "Unknown" label for unrecognized faces
- **Optimized Performance**: Uses frame resizing for faster processing
- **Easy Setup**: Simple folder-based image management

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Core Functions

- **`load_images_from_folder(folder_path)`**: Loads reference images from the faces directory and extracts names from filenames
- **`find_encodings(images)`**: Converts images to RGB format and generates face encodings using face_recognition library
- **`main()`**: Main execution function that handles video capture, face detection, recognition, and display

### Key Technologies

- **OpenCV**: Video capture, image processing, and display
- **face_recognition**: Face detection and encoding generation
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations and array manipulation
- **DeepFace**: Advanced face analysis capabilities
- **Gradio**: Potential web interface support

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Webcam connected to your system
- Windows/macOS/Linux

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone or download this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd face_recognition
   ```

2. **Install required packages**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Prepare reference images**
   - Add photos of people you want to recognize to the `faces/` folder
   - Use clear, well-lit photos showing the face clearly
   - Name files with the person's name (e.g., `john_doe.jpg`)
   - Supported formats: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## üéÆ Usage Instructions

1. **Start the application**: Run `python main.py`
2. **Position yourself**: Ensure good lighting and face the camera
3. **View results**: 
   - Known faces will be highlighted in **green** with their names
   - Unknown faces will be highlighted in **red** labeled as "Unknown"
4. **Exit**: Press `q` to quit the application

**Warnings and Notes:**
- Ensure that your webcam is connected and functioning properly before running the script.
- The script captures video from webcam index 2; you may need to adjust this if you have multiple webcams or if the default index does not work.

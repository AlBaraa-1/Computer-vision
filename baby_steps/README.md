# 🎯 Computer Vision: Baby Steps

A comprehensive collection of fundamental OpenCV implementations, covering essential image processing and computer vision techniques.

## 📚 What I've Built

This project contains 12 practical implementations demonstrating core computer vision concepts:

### 📥 Input/Output Operations
- **Image I/O** - Loading and displaying images
- **Video Processing** - Reading and writing video files
- **Webcam Integration** - Real-time camera feed handling

### 🖼️ Image Manipulation
- **Image Cropping** - Extracting regions of interest
- **Resizing** - Scaling images with various interpolation methods
- **Color Space Conversion** - Converting between RGB, HSV, Grayscale, and more

### 🎨 Image Processing Techniques
- **Blurring** - Gaussian, Median, and Bilateral filtering
- **Thresholding** - Binary, adaptive, and Otsu's thresholding
- **Edge Detection** - Canny edge detection algorithm
- **Drawing Shapes** - Lines, rectangles, circles, and text overlays

### 🔍 Advanced Features
- **Contour Detection** - Finding and drawing object contours
- **Face Detection** - Implementing Haar Cascade classifiers for face detection

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** - Primary programming language
- **OpenCV** - Computer vision library
- **NumPy** - Numerical computing

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# Install required dependencies
pip install opencv-python numpy

# Run any example
python 01_io_img.py
```

Social media has become a powerful force in shaping public opinion. Platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok allow information to spread at lightning speed, giving everyone a voiceâ€”but also amplifying misinformation. Algorithms often prioritize engagement over accuracy, meaning sensational or emotionally charged posts are more likely to go viral. While this helps important social issues gain attention, it can also deepen divisions and spread false narratives. To navigate this digital landscape, users need to think critically, verify sources, and be aware of how algorithms influence what they see online.

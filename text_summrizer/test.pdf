Climate change is not just an environmental issue—it’s an economic, social, and political challenge. Rising temperatures and extreme weather events disrupt agriculture, water supplies, and global trade, creating ripple effects that reach every corner of society. While renewable energy technologies like solar and wind are becoming more affordable, many industries and governments remain slow to adopt them due to high transition costs and political resistance. Meanwhile, developing nations face the greatest risks despite contributing the least to the problem. Solving climate change requires global cooperation, innovation, and a shift in how economies measure success—not just by profit, but by sustainability.
